## 🤔 Why TARP?

I got my first job as a Data Engineer using Scala. It's been now more than 3 years, reaching 4 years. The more experience you gain the more you want to spread your wings 🪽 to build even bigger and complex things than just data pipelines.

But, I really do not want to dissipate myself too much on all the programming languages out there 😣. Progamming languages are just a mean to an end, what is important is how efficient you are with it for producing the product or feature you in-visioned 🦄🌈. Sooo! For me, currently it's:

- 🦛 **Tapir**: For the backend, it's a FastAPI kind of like lightweight library for building endpoint plus giving a free SwaggerUI docs.
- ⚛️ **React**: For the frontend, the most popular and with the biggest community according.
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL**: For the database, same because of popularity and community.

I'm really excited to show it Let's start building shall we! 😣
Do you know what a "TARP" is 🤣? A tarp functions as a waterproof protective cover, for example, when building tents ⛺.
