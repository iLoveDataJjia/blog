I landed my first job as a Data Engineer using Scala. It's been over 3 years now, approaching 4 years. The more experience you gain, the more you want to spread your wings 🪽 to tackle even bigger and more complex projects than just data pipelines, like developing **full-stack web data applications**. But, I really do not want to dissipate myself too much on all the programming languages, libraries, or frameworks out there 😣. These are just tools. What's important is how efficiently you can use them for the product or feature you envisioned 🦄🌈. Sooo! For me, it's currently the **TARP** tech stack!

## 🤔 What is TARP?

**TARP** stands for **Tapir**, **React** and **PostgreSQL**. In detail:

- 🦛 **Tapir**: For the backend, it's a lightweight library similar to FastAPI, designed for building endpoints and providing free SwaggerUI docs.
- ⚛️ **React**: For the frontend, it's the most popular framework with the largest community, according to the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-web-frameworks-and-technologies).
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for the database due to its popularity and strong community support, as indicated by the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-web-frameworks-and-technologies).

I'm really excited 😄 to demonstrate how productive you can be with this tech stack. Let's start building, shall we! By the way, do you know what "TARP" stands for? 🤣 A tarp functions as a waterproof protective cover, for example, when building tents ⛺.
